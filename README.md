### When creating new post we should consider some points

1. Posts should be in `_posts` folder
2. In that folder click `Create new file`. 
3. File name should be in this format `year-month-day-file-name.md(2020-02-04-somthing.md) in the place of something, must be written some word` .
4. Recently edited posts are visible on top of the blog posts listings.
