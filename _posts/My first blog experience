### This is my first blog experience.

Recently I saw a fastai blog, in that jeremy explained how easily anyone can create their own blog. The template is great, but I couldn't 
follow it but it is wonderful initiative. Then I searched google is there any one tried jeremy's template then I found this 
[medium blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-your-free-blog-site-204a5e27f197) and I followed his github repo to create this blog.
